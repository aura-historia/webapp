        Creates or updates multiple items in a single batch request.
        This endpoint accepts a collection of item data and processes them asynchronously.
        
        **Shop Enrichment**: The shop information (shopId and shopName) is automatically 
        enriched based on the item's URL. The URL must belong to a shop that is already 
        registered in the system. If the shop is not found, the item will fail with 
        a SHOP_NOT_FOUND error.
        
        **Response Structure**:
        - `skipped`: Number of items that had no changes and were skipped
        - `unprocessed`: URLs of items that could not be processed due to temporary issues (can be retried)
        - `failed`: Map of item URLs to error codes for items that permanently failed processing
        
        Returns information about any items that could not be processed or failed during enrichment.
