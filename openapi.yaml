            description: |
                Retrieves a single product by its shop ID and shop's product ID.
                Returns localized content based on Accept-Language header and currency preferences.
                Optionally includes product history when requested.
                
                **Personalization**: When authenticated (via optional Authorization header), the response includes
                user-specific state such as whether the product is on the user's watchlist and notification preferences.
                Anonymous requests receive product data without user state.

                Retrieves products similar to the specified product using semantic search based on text embeddings.
                Returns localized content based on Accept-Language header and currency preferences.
                
                **Personalization**: When authenticated (via optional Authorization header), the response includes
                user-specific state for each similar product (watchlist status, notifications).
                Anonymous requests receive product data without user state.
                
                **Asynchronous Processing**: If the product's text embedding has not yet been computed (typically for 
                products created less than 24 hours ago), the endpoint returns 202 Accepted with a Location header 
                to poll. The embedding generation runs nightly via batch processing.

                Creates or updates multiple products in a single batch request.
                This endpoint accepts a collection of product data and processes them asynchronously.
                
                **Shop Enrichment**: The shop information (shopId and shopName) is automatically 
                enriched based on the product's URL. The domain is extracted from the product URL 
                and must match a shop that is already registered in the system. If the shop is not 
                found, the product will fail with a SHOP_NOT_FOUND error. If the URL does not contain 
                a valid extractable domain, the product will fail with a NO_DOMAIN error.
                
                **Response Structure**:
                - `skipped`: Number of products that had no changes and were skipped
                - `unprocessed`: URLs of products that could not be processed due to temporary issues (can be retried)
                - `failed`: Map of product URLs to error codes for products that permanently failed processing
                
                Returns information about any products that could not be processed or failed during enrichment.
