# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Deployment

This application is deployed to Cloudflare Workers as part of the CI workflow. Deployments happen automatically after all CI checks pass.

### Automatic Deployments

- **Production** (`main` branch) → https://aura-historia.com
  - Triggers: Push to `main` branch
  - Requirements: All CI checks pass (lint, test, SonarQube, build)
  
- **Staging** (`dev` branch) → https://stage.aura-historia.com
  - Triggers: Push to `dev` branch
  - Requirements: All CI checks pass (lint, test, SonarQube, build)

- **Preview Deployments** (Pull Requests) → Automatic preview URLs via Cloudflare
  - CI runs on PRs but does **not** deploy
  - Cloudflare's GitHub integration can create preview deployments

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI workflow runs in this order:
1. **Lint** - Code formatting and linting checks
2. **Test** - TypeScript compilation and unit tests with coverage
3. **SonarQube** - Code quality analysis
4. **Build** - Production build
5. **Deploy** - Deployment to Cloudflare (only on pushes to `main`/`dev`, not on PRs)

### Manual Deployments

You can also deploy manually using the following commands:

```bash
# Deploy to production
pnpm run deploy:production

# Deploy to staging
pnpm run deploy:staging
```

**Note**: Manual deployments require the following environment variables to be set:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID

### Secrets

Required secrets in GitHub Actions:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Cloudflare API token with Workers deployment permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
- `VITE_USER_POOL_ID` - AWS Cognito User Pool ID
- `VITE_CLIENT_ID` - AWS Cognito Client ID

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing.

### Unit Tests

You can run the unit tests with:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### E2E Tests

E2E tests are powered by Playwright and test the application from a user's perspective across different browsers.

Run E2E tests:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e

pnpm run test:e2e:ui
```

**Note**: E2E tests require Playwright browsers to be installed. In CI/CD, this happens automatically. For local development, run:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install
```

The E2E tests are configured to:
- Run against Chromium in development for faster feedback
- Run against Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit in CI for comprehensive coverage
- Automatically start the dev server before running tests
- Generate HTML reports and traces for debugging failures

E2E tests run automatically in the CI pipeline when pushing to or creating PRs against the main branch.

## Routing
This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).


## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/people",
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people");
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>;
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData();
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  },
});
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into you application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["people"],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

## State Management

Another common requirement for React applications is state management. There are many options for state management in React. TanStack Store provides a great starting point for your project.

First you need to add TanStack Store as a dependency:

```bash
pnpm install @tanstack/store
```

Now let's create a simple counter in the `src/App.tsx` file as a demonstration.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

One of the many nice features of TanStack Store is the ability to derive state from other state. That derived state will update when the base state updates.

Let's check this out by doubling the count using derived state.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store, Derived } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

const doubledStore = new Derived({
  fn: () => countStore.state * 2,
  deps: [countStore],
});
doubledStore.mount();

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  const doubledCount = useStore(doubledStore);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
      <div>Doubled - {doubledCount}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We use the `Derived` class to create a new store that is derived from another store. The `Derived` class has a `mount` method that will start the derived store updating.

Once we've created the derived store we can use it in the `App` component just like we would any other store using the `useStore` hook.

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use TanStack Store in the [TanStack Store documentation](https://tanstack.com/store/latest).
