          "question": "How does Aura Historia compare to Barnebys?",
          "answer": "While Barnebys is also an antiques search engine, they only focus on the largest players - the big auction houses and dealers. This makes up for a very high chance for you to miss out on what you're actually searching for. Ask yourself, where did I find my biggest treasures? It probably was a small local dealer or even thrift store."
        },
        "comparisonPriceDatabase": {
          "question": "How does Aura Historia compare to price databases like WorthPoint and the salesroom?",
          "answer": "Price databases leverage the sheer amount of historical data with auction results dating back to the 90s. While this helps finding comparisons for astronomically rare pieces, it often deflects the current market-value and availability of antiques. If your goal is to find antiques or research their current value, Aura Historia is the right place. We also want to take a heavy standpoint against the monetization of historical antique pricing data. You should not need to pay to find out what sold at which price."
